*Bgp At Doors of Autonomous Systems is Simple*

## Overview
GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to emulate, configure, test and troubleshoot virtual and real networks. In our case, it allows us to emulate a network traffic using BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).  

BGP is the protocol that makes the Internet work by enabling data routing. When a user in Singapore loads a website with origin servers in Argentina, BGP is the protocol that enables that communication to happen quickly and efficiently.
